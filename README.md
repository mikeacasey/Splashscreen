Staying online in windows using Autohotkey

Every 30 seconds moves the mouse one pixel alternately NW-SW to maintain on screen activity. After 30 seconds show a splash image on the main screen and black on the other screens. WIN+Z to reopen or close manually.

The use-case is to avoid screen lock and having to re-insert password. Can also maintain the illusion of being continuously online in a remote working scenario.
